## Idea of the Day
**Roof Age Estimator for Home Inspectors**

From email: "12 Years. Maybe 15." - Standing on the ladder, squinting at shingles, the inspector guesses. Then the insurance adjuster disagrees. Deal falls through.

## What I Built
AI-powered mobile web tool that estimates roof age from photos:
- Material type detection (asphalt 3-tab, architectural shingle, etc.)
- Age estimate with confidence score
- Granule loss and curling analysis
- Estimated remaining life
- Mobile-friendly (works from the ladder)

```
Home inspectors lose deals when adjusters disagree on roof age.

Built a free tool that estimates roof age from a photo:
• Detects material type
• Analyzes granule loss  
• Returns confidence score

No more guessing.
